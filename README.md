## Notes
This project draws healivy from [Responsive Real-Time Grass Rendering for General 3D Scenes](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2017/JAHRMANN-2017-RRTG/JAHRMANN-2017-RRTG-draft.pdf). It simulates the movement of grass blades, taking into account recovery, gravity, and wind forces. It also implements culling based on three different tests: distance, orientation, and view-frustum.

This project currently has bugs/errors that I do not know how to solve, but contains a large amount of code intended to implement the various components mentioned.
